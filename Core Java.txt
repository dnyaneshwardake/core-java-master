Core Java

Features of Java 

1. Simple
2. Object Oriented Proframming
3. Platform Independant - Can run same class file on multiple platforms/operating system
4. Portable - We can carry .class files and run on diffrent machines
5. Secured - No pointers in Java like in C++, C
6. Multithreaded - 
7. Architectural Nutral - Java works on 32/x86 bit and x64 bit operating system (platform)
8. High Performence - By using thrads, Memory managmnet (JVM - Garbage collector)
9. Dynanmic - We can load classes dynamically


C++ vs Java diffrence

1. C++ is platform dependant , Java is platform independant.
2. C++ is used for system programming, Java used in Application development, Website, Application, Banking Application
3. C++ have pointer concepts, Java don't have pointers.
4. Multiple inheritence possible in C++, Not possible in Java (ambugity while resolving methods call)
5. In C++ we have call by value and call by reference, In java we have only call by value
6. C++ Multithreading support but using 3rd party lib. Java has inbuild support for Multithreading


JVM / JRE / JDK

JVM: Java Virtual Machine

Steps for java code execution:
1. .class file created (after compilation)
2. Class loaders 
3. Bytecode Verify .class file
4. Interpreater (Computer understandable code )
5. Run .class file
